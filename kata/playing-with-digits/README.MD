<p>
Some numbers have funny properties. For example:

&gt; 89 --&gt; 8¹ + 9² = 89 * 1

&gt; 695 --&gt; 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2

&gt; 46288 --&gt; 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51

Given a positive integer n written as abcd... (a, b, c, d... being digits) and a positive integer p 
- we want to find a positive integer k, if it exists, such as the sum of the digits of n taken to the successive powers of p is equal to k * n. 

In other words:


&gt; Is there an integer k such as : (a ^ p + b ^ (p+1) + c ^(p+2) + d ^ (p+3) + ...) = n * k

If it is the case we will return k, if not return -1.

**Note**: n and p will always be given as strictly positive integers.

dig_pow(89, 1) should return 1 since 8¹ + 9² = 89 = 89 * 1
