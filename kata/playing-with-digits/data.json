  "description": "Some numbers have funny properties. For example:\n\n> 89 --> 8¹ + 9² = 89 * 1\n\n> 695 --> 6² + 9³ + 5⁴= 1390 = 695 * 2\n\n> 46288 --> 4³ + 6⁴+ 2⁵ + 8⁶ + 8⁷ = 2360688 = 46288 * 51\n\nGiven a positive integer n written as abcd... (a, b, c, d... being digits) and a positive integer p \n- we want to find a positive integer k, if it exists, such as the sum of the digits of n taken to the successive powers of p is equal to k * n. \n\nIn other words:\n\n\n> Is there an integer k such as : (a ^ p + b ^ (p+1) + c ^(p+2) + d ^ (p+3) + ...) = n * k\n\nIf it is the case we will return k, if not return -1.\n\n**Note**: n and p will always be given as strictly positive integers.\n\n```julia\ndig_pow(89, 1) should return 1 since 8¹ + 9² = 89 = 89 * 1\ndig_pow(92, 1) should return -1 since there is no k such as 9¹ + 2² equals 92 *
