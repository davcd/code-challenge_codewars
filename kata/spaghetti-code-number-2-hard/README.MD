<p>
# Hooray - It's &quot;Spaghetti Night&quot; again !

Spaghetti is my favourite meal, so I always like to save the longest piece for last...

But since my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codewars.com/kata/57d7805cec167081a50014ac&quot;&gt;last &quot;Spaghetti Night&quot;&lt;/a&gt; the price of my special ID spaghetti has really gone through the roof and so I have changed to a cheaper brand. 

Unfortunately, this cheaper spaghetti only has a SINGLE ID somewhere on each piece of spaghetti.

Oh well, at least it tastes the same.


# Task

Write some spaghetti code to help me know which piece of spaghetti is the longest.

Try NOT to write spaghetti code that looks like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code&quot;&gt;spaghetti code&lt;/a&gt; !

NOTES

* Spaghetti pieces all look the same (&quot;S&quot;) except for a single uppercase letter unique ID *somewhere* on the piece (which may also be &quot;S&quot;)
* Spaghetti pieces do not touch each other, or themselves
* Spaghetti pieces twist only up, down, left, right (not diagonally)
* If multiple spaghetti pieces are longest, just return any one of them (all spaghetti tastes the same)
* If the plate has no spaghetti then return empty string
* All of my plates are rectangular 
* Plates can have any (non alphabetic) background pattern on them
