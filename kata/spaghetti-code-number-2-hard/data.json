  "description": "# Hooray - It's \"Spaghetti Night\" again !\n\nSpaghetti is my favourite meal, so I always like to save the longest piece for last...\n\nBut since my <a href=\"https://www.codewars.com/kata/57d7805cec167081a50014ac\">last \"Spaghetti Night\"</a> the price of my special ID spaghetti has really gone through the roof and so I have changed to a cheaper brand. \n\nUnfortunately, this cheaper spaghetti only has a SINGLE ID somewhere on each piece of spaghetti.\n\nOh well, at least it tastes the same.\n\n\n# Task\n\nWrite some spaghetti code to help me know which piece of spaghetti is the longest.\n\nTry NOT to write spaghetti code that looks like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code\">spaghetti code</a> !\n\nNOTES\n\n* Spaghetti pieces all look the same (\"S\") except for a single uppercase letter unique ID *somewhere* on the piece (which may also be \"S\")\n* Spaghetti pieces do not touch each other, or themselves\n* Spaghetti pieces twist only up, down, left, right (not diagonally)\n* If multiple spaghetti pieces are longest, just return any one of them (all spaghetti tastes the same)\n* If the plate has no spaghetti then return empty string\n* All of my plates are rectangular \n* Plates can have any (non alphabetic) background pattern on them\n\n# Examples\n\nEx1\n```\nSSSSSASS____\n____________\nSSSSSSBSSSS_\n____________\nSSSSSC______\n```\n*Answer:* ```B```\n\n<hr>\nEx2\n```\nSSSSSSSSS   \n________S__SSS_\n S   S  A    S \n_S___S__S____S_\n B   S       S \n_S___SSSSSCSSS_\n```\n*Answer:* ```C```\n\n\n",
