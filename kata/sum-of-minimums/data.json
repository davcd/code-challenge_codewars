  "description": "~~~if:csharp,javascript,cfml,php\nGiven a 2D array of size `m * n`. Your task is to find the sum of minimum value in each row.\n~~~\n~~~if:cpp\nGiven a 2D vector of size `m * n`. Your task is to find the sum of minimum value in each row.\n~~~\n~~~if:python,ruby\nGiven a 2D list of size `m * n`. Your task is to find the sum of minimum value in each row.\n~~~\n\nFor Example:\n```cpp\n{\n  {1,2,3,4,5},       // minimum value of row is 1\n  {5,6,7,8,9},       // minimum value of row is 5\n  {20,21,34,56,100}  // minimum value of row is 20\n}\n```\n```csharp\n{\n  {1,2,3,4,5},       // minimum value of row is 1\n  {5,6,7,8,9},       // minimum value of row is 5\n  {20,21,34,56,100}  // minimum value of row is 20\n}\n```\n```python\n[\n  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],       # minimum value of row is 1\n  [5, 6, 7, 8, 9],       # minimum value of row is 5\n  [20, 21, 34, 56, 100]  # minimum value of row is 20\n]\n```\n```ruby\n[\n  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],       # minimum value of row is 1\n  [5, 6, 7, 8, 9],       # minimum value of row is 5\n  [20, 21, 34, 56, 100]  # minimum value of row is 20\n]\n```\n```javascript\n[\n  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],       // minimum value of row is 1\n  [5, 6, 7, 8, 9],       // minimum value of row is 5\n  [20, 21, 34, 56, 100]  // minimum value of row is 20\n]\n```\n```cfml\n[\n  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],       // minimum value of row is 1\n  [5, 6, 7, 8, 9],       // minimum value of row is 5\n  [20, 21, 34, 56, 100]  // minimum value of row is 20\n]\n```\n```php\n[\n  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],       # minimum value of row is 1\n  [5, 6, 7, 8, 9],       # minimum value of row is 5\n  [20, 21, 34, 56, 100]  # minimum value of row is 20\n]\n```\nSo, the function should return `26` because sum of minimums is as `1 + 5 + 20 = 26`\n\n~~~if:javascript,php\nNote: You will be always given non-empty array containing Positive values.\n~~~\n~~~if:python\nNote: You will be always given non-empty list containing Positive values.\n~~~\n~~~if:cpp\nNote: You will be always given non-empty vector containing Positive values.\n~~~\n~~~if:c#\nNote: You will be always given non-empty vector containing Positive values.\n~~~\n~~~if:cfml\nNote: You will be always given non-empty array containing Positive values.\n~~~\n\nENJOY CODING :)\n",
