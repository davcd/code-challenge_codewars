Some people want to go down. \n\nThe floor they want to go to is represented by a number (i.e. when they enter the Lift this is the button they will press)\n\n```\nBEFORE (people waiting in queues)               AFTER (people at their destinations)\n                   +--+                                          +--+ \n  /----------------|  |----------------\\        /----------------|  |----------------\\\n10|                |  | 1,4,3,2        |      10|             10 |  |                |\n  |----------------|  |----------------|        |----------------|  |----------------|\n 9|                |  | 1,10,2         |       9|                |  |                |\n  |----------------|  |----------------|        |----------------|  |----------------|\n 8|                |  |                |       8|                |  |                |\n  |----------------|  |----------------|        |----------------|  |----------------|\n 7|                |  | 3,6,4,5,6      |       7|                |  |                |\n  |----------------|  |----------------|        |----------------|  |----------------|\n 6|                |  |                |       6|          6,6,6 |  |                |\n  |----------------|  |----------------|        |----------------|  |----------------|\n 5|                |  |                |       5|            5,5 |  |                |\n  |----------------|  |----------------|        |----------------|  |----------------|\n 4|                |  | 0,0,0          |       4|          4,4,4 |  |                |\n  |----------------|  |----------------|        |----------------|  |----------------|\n 3|                |  |                |       3|            3,3 |  |                |\n  |----------------|  |----------------|        |----------------|  |----------------|\n 2|                |  | 4              |       2|          2,2,2 |  |                |\n  |----------------|  |----------------|        |----------------|  |----------------|\n 1|                |  | 6,5,2          |       1|            1,1 |  |                |\n  |----------------|  |----------------|        |----------------|  |----------------|\n G|                |  |                |       G|          0,0,0 |  |                |\n  |====================================|        |====================================|\n```\n<hr>\n\n# Rules\n\n#### Lift Rules\n\n* The Lift only goes up or down!\n* Each floor has both UP and DOWN Lift-call buttons (except top and ground floors which have only DOWN and UP respectively)\n* The Lift never changes direction until there are no more people wanting to get on/off in the direction it is already travelling\n* When empty the Lift tries to be smart. For example,\n * If it was going up then it may continue up to collect the highest floor person wanting to go down\n * If it was going down then it may continue down to collect the lowest floor person wanting to go up\n* The Lift has a maximum capacity of people \n* When called, the Lift will stop at a floor **even if it is full**, although unless somebody gets off nobody else can get on!\n* If the lift is empty, and no people are waiting, then it will return to the ground floor\n \n#### People Rules\n\n* People are in **\"queues\"** that represent their order of arrival to wait for the Lift\n* All people can press the UP/DOWN Lift-call buttons\n* Only people going the **same direction** as the Lift may enter it\n* Entry is according to the **\"queue\" order**, but those unable to enter do not block those behind them that can\n* If a person is unable to enter a full Lift, they will press the UP/DOWN Lift-call button again after it has departed without them\n\n \n<hr> \n\n# Kata Task\n\n* Get all the people to the floors they want to go to while obeying the **Lift rules** and the **People rules**\n* Return a list of all floors that the Lift stopped at (in the order visited!)\n\nNOTE: The Lift always starts on the ground floor (and people waiting on the ground floor may enter immediately)\n\n<hr>\n\n# I/O\n\n#### Input\n\n* ```queues``` a list of queues of people for all floors of the building. \n * The height of the building varies\n * 0 = the ground floor\n * Not all floors have queues\n * Queue index [0] is the \"head\" of the queue\n * Numbers indicate which floor the person wants go to\n* ```capacity``` maximum number of people allowed in the lift\n\n*Parameter validation* - All input parameters can be assumed OK. No need to check for things like:\n\n* People wanting to go to floors that do not exist\n* People wanting to take the Lift to the floor they are already on\n* Buildings with < 2 floors\n* Basements\n\n#### Output\n\n* A list of all floors that the Lift stopped at (in the order visited!)\n\n<hr>\n\n# Example\n\nRefer to the example test cases.\n\n<hr>\n\n# Language Notes\n\n* Python : The object will be initialized for you in the tests\n\n<hr>\n<span style=\"color:red\">\nGood Luck -\n\nDM\n\n</span>\n\n\n\n\n\n",
