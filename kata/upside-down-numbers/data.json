  "description": "Consider the numbers `6969` and `9116`. When you rotate them `180 degrees` (upside down), these numbers remain the same. To clarify, if we write them down on a paper and turn the paper upside down, the numbers will be the same. Try it and see! Some numbers such as `2` or `5` don't yield numbers when rotated.\n\nGiven a range, return the count of upside down numbers within that range.  For example, `solve(0,10) = 3`, because there are only `3` upside down numbers `>= 0 and < 10`. They are `0, 1, 8`.\n\nMore examples in the test cases.\n\nGood luck!\n\nIf you like this Kata, please try \n\n[Simple Prime Streaming](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a908da30025e995880000e3)\n\n[Life without primes](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59f8750ac374cba8f0000033)\n\nPlease also try the performance version of this kata at [Upside down numbers - Challenge Edition ](https://www.codewars.com/kata/59f98052120be4abfa000304)",
